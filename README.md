# Student Tracker

A simple Python-based student activity tracking system designed to record, update, and manage student information using core Python logic and basic data structures. This project demonstrates the use of functions, loops, conditionals, and modular programming without relying on external storage files.

## Features
- Add new student records  
- Update existing student details  
- View all student entries  
- Search student information by name or ID  
- Simple menu-driven console interface  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Core Python concepts:
  - `while` loops  
  - `for` loops  
  - `range()`  
  - Functions (`def`)  
  - Dictionaries & Lists  
  - Input validation  

## How It Works
The program maintains all student data in a dictionary.  
Users interact through a continuous menu using a `while` loop.  
Each feature is handled by a separate function to keep the code clean and modular.

## Purpose of the Project
This project was created as a beginner-friendly demonstration of Python fundamentals in action.  
It can be used by students learning programming, or as a template for more advanced database-backed applications.
