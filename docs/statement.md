# Project Statement

## 1. Problem Statement
Managing student information manually often leads to disorganized records, missing details, and inefficient tracking. Basic institutions and small academic groups need a simple digital solution to store and access student details without requiring advanced software or database systems. This project aims to address this problem by creating a lightweight, menu-driven Python application that helps track student information efficiently.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes:
- Recording and storing basic student details during runtime.
- Allowing users to update, view, and search student records.
- Providing a simple and intuitive console interface.
- Demonstrating core Python programming concepts such as loops, functions, and dictionaries.

The project does not include advanced database systems, permanent storage, or a graphical interface, as the focus is on fundamental logic and structure.

## 3. Target Users
- Students learning Python fundamentals.
- Beginners who want to understand data handling through dictionaries and functions.
- Teachers or mentors looking for a simple demonstration model for classroom use.
- Small academic groups needing a lightweight, non-database student tracking tool.

## 4. High-Level Features
- Add new student records using an interactive input system.
- View all stored student details in a structured format.
- Search for specific students using ID or name.
- Update existing records through a guided process.
- Menu-driven interface that repeats until the user chooses to exit.
